Here are key points to pull from the readings: 
The 2 quotes I found interesting were "In order to understand how broad information technology is, you should first understand some of the varying roles. Each role has a specialized focus such as analyists, scientists, architects, programmers and administrators." That was interesting to me because I do consider taking a job off this after I move on from college and start working even after reading the job list. Another quote is "In Cloud Computing, you do need to understand how Storage works when you configure a computer or server in the cloud." That interested me as well because I get worried of overloading my MacBook.
Here are all the facts I have outline from learning: Storage is where you keep files for your operating system, applications and documents. There are two types of storage devices used with computers and servers, a primary storage device and a secondary storage device. Primary storage generally holds files for the operating system and any critical applications. Secondary storage can be removable, internal, or external and can be used to hold files or applications depending on the setup.
